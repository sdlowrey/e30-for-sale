<p><strong>This car is not street legal.</strong></p>

<div>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Prepared for SCCA E Production racing. This is a solid, reliable car that's been sitting in climate-controlled storage for the last few years. Starts and runs fine, probably needs new rubber and an overall inspection, otherwise ready to go.</p>
    <p>The hood has a small crack from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_49XsE1LZNE">minor bounce off a tire wall at Summit Point</a> (oil on the track in a braking zone - yahoo!). The right front fender was replaced as a result (it's flat black and doesn't match the stock gloss black paint.) The damage was cosmetic; I raced the car later the same day without any problems.</p>

    <h2>Engine and Fuel System</h2>
    <p>Engine is basically stock, except for header, exhaust, fan, newer Motronic 172, DME, and stripped wiring harness. Always used RedLine racing oil in the crankcase, distilled water in the radiator, and pump gas.</p>

    <p>Stock saddle tank removed, FuelSafe racing cell in the trunk. Holley 8psi first-stage pump, Kinsler swirl pot, metered return line, high-pressure second stage pump and filter. Interior send and return lines with fittings at the rear bulkhead and firewall. Stock fuel rail, regulator, and injectors. Electric fuel pressure gauge on the dash.</p>

    <h2>Suspension</h2>
    Ground Control blah blah. spherical bearings, IE bars. Set up for Hoosier radial slicks. Wheels are (brand, size, weight?).

    <h2>Drive Train</h2>
    Five speed Getrag 265, B&M short shifter, stock drive shaft and center bearing, 4.10 rear diff (have original 3.73), stock axles and hubs.

    <h2>Exterior</h2>
    <p>Fiberglass hood (5 pins). Ireland Engineering fiberglass deck lid (Dzus fastened). Lexan rear and quarter windows. Rear bumper delete. Sunroof delete. Plastic Ireland Engineering fender flares.</p>

    <h2>Interior</h2>
    <p>Roll cage built by Piper Motorsport. Anchored to firewall and rear floor. Includes door bars on the driver side, dead pedal, and window net attachment points.</p>

    <h2>Also For Sale</h2>
    <p>I have a partial M3 composite body kit made by Mario Langsten at <a href="http://www.vsr1.com/">Vintage Sports & Restoration</a>. The kit includes air dam, hood (installed), front fenders, and side skirts. (VSR wasn't able to provide rear quarter panels or rear bumper cover.) Note that these are <i>not</i> BMW parts; they're lightweight composites. Make me an offer.</p>
