    <h1 id="overview">For Sale: 1987 BMW 325is Racer</h1>
    <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Based on a 1987 BMW E30 325is, this car was tracked as a street car with various clubs before being prepped for SCCA E Production racing in 2009. The car was entered mostly in SCCA races and PDX events in the Mid-Atlantic area through October 2013. Achieved several class wins and a season championship.</h5>

      <img src="images/driver-side-ext.jpg" alt="Driver Side Exterior" class="w3-image">

      <p>This is a solid, reliable car that's been stored in a climate-controlled garage for the last few years. It starts and runs fine. Will need new tires and tech inspection. Could use some cosmetic touch-ups too. Otherwise, it's ready to go. I have the SCCA logbook and documentation/paperwork for most of the work that's been done.</p>

    <h1 id="engine">Engine & Driveline</h1>

    <h3>Engine</h3>
      <h5>BMW M20 with stock crank, pistons, intake, and valve train. Straight exhaust. Simplified cooling and electrical. The SCCA rules allow a lot more to be done with this engine, including 12:1 pistons, bigger cam, and a modern ECU.</h5>

      <img src="images/engine.jpg" alt="Engine Bay" class="w3-image">

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.crank-scrapers.com/">I-J crank scraper</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://www.iemotorsport.com/bmw/item/e30headerss.html">Ireland Engineering shorty exhaust header</a> <em>(not stainless steel)</em></li>
        <li>Custom side-exit exhaust, 18" glass pack race muffler</li>
        <li>Powermaster Denso-style race alternator</li>
        <li>Spal 16" electric puller fan</li>
        <li>Motronic 172 DME (have original 152 DME)</li>
        <li>Stripped wiring harness</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The wiring harness was stripped to remove OBD1, fuel and O2-heat relays, gauge cluster ... and any other wiring not required for proper engine control. This was done for a few reasons, but the main problem was an occasional cut-out midway in the rev range.  The harness is now simpler, lighter, and easier to work on when needed.</p>

      <p>All unnecessary coolant lines removed. No thermostat.</p>
      <p>Stock steering rack. Power steering pump removed (can be reinstalled if desired).</p>

      <p>Red Line 50W racing oil in the crankcase, distilled water in the radiator.</p>

      <p>FuelSafe racing cell mounted flush with trunk floor (spare tire well removed, stock tank removed). Holley 8psi first-stage pump, Kinsler swirl pot, metered return line, fuel sampling port, high-pressure second stage pump and filter. Interior send and return lines with fittings at the rear bulkhead and firewall. Stock fuel rail, regulator, and injectors. Electric fuel pressure gauge on the dash. Runs on pump gas.</p>

      <img src="images/fuel-cell.jpg" alt="Trunk Fuel Cell" class="w3-image">

    <h3>Driveline</h3>
      <h5>Lightweight flywheel, single-disc race clutch, stock 5-speed Getrag 265, 4.10 limited-slip differential. Stock axles and hubs.</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.jbracing.com/">JBRacing</a> aluminum flywheel</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.clutchmasters.com/">Clutch Masters</a> stage 5 clutch</li>
        <li>B&M short shifter</li>
        <li>Stock drive shaft and center bearing</li>
        <li>4.10 rear diff with sold Delrin mount</li>
        <li>Urethane engine and gearbox mounts</li>
    </ul>

      <p>The clutch uses a heavy duty pressure plate with a soild six-puck ceramic disc.</p>

      <p>The flywheel and clutch came from <a href="http://www.bimmerworld.com/">BimmerWorld</a> as a kit. The pressure plate and wheel were balanced at Tyson's Automotive Machine in Sterling, VA. The result is faster engine revving and clutch engagement.</p>

      <p>The stock 3.73 diff was replaced with a stock 4.10, which allows better use of the gear range at tracks like Summit Point. (Original diff is included in sale.)</p>

    <p>ABS module deleted. New brake lines. Front-rear brake bias control mounted on tunnel next to driver seat. Emergency brake deleted.</p>

      <p>I ran the car with the rear sway bar disconnected which keeps the inside front wheel planted better on fast sweepers.</p>

      <p>The hood has a small crack from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_49XsE1LZNE">minor bounce off a tire wall at Summit Point</a> (oil on the track in a braking zone - yahoo). I never got around to fixing it. All 5 pins still align. The right front fender was also replaced (it's flat black and doesn't match the stock gloss black paint). The damage was limited to body panels (the car was raced later the same day).</p>

      <p>I also have a partial M3 composite body kit made by Mario Langsten at <a href="http://www.vsr1.com/">Vintage Sports & Restoration</a>. The kit includes air dam, front fenders, and side skirts. (VSR wasn't able to provide rear quarter panels or rear bumper cover.) Note that these are <i>not</i> BMW parts; they're lightweight composites. Make me an offer.</p>

      <h5>Maintenance and Safety</h5>
      The car was legal for SCCA E Production in 2013. I don't think that has changed, but check the rules for the class or event type you want to run in.
      <ul>
          <li>The FIA-rated Sparco seat was manufactured in 2007. A seat back brace can be installed for clubs that require it.</li>
          <li>The Schroth harness is good through 2019.</li>
          <li>The fire bottles should be checked and refilled as necessary. The ESS bottle is refillable.</li>
          <li>Fuel cell foam was replaced when the cell was installed in 2009. According to the latest GCR, the bladders do not expire.
          <li>The window net is SFI certified.</li>
          <li>No interior net. This is required by some clubs, including BMWCCA.</li>
          <li>Bleed the brake system and check the pads.</li>
          <li>Drain and refill the cooling system.</li>
          <li>Change engine oil. Gearbox and diff should be OK.</li>
