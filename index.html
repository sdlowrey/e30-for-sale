    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>Based on a 1987 BMW 325is, this car was tracked as a street car with various clubs before being prepped for SCCA E Production racing in 2009. The car was entered mostly in SCCA races and PDX events in the Mid-Atlantic area. Achieved several class wins and a season championship. Last event was October 2013.</p>

    <p>This is a solid, reliable car that's been stored in a climate-controlled garage. It starts and runs fine. Will need new tires and tech inspection (have SCCA log book). Could use some cosmetic touch-ups too. Otherwise, it's ready to go.</p>

    <h2 id="engine">Engine and Fuel System</h2>
    <p>Engine is basically stock except for the following.
    <ul>
    <li>Motronic 172 DME (have original 152 DME)</li>
    <li>Ireland Engineering shorty header</li>
    <li>Custom side-exit exhaust, 18" glass pack race muffler</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.crank-scrapers.com/">I-J crank scraper</a></li>
    <li>Powermaster Denso-style race alternator</li>
    <li>Spal 16" electric puller fan</li>
    <li>Lightweight aluminum flywheel</li>
    <li>Stripped engine wiring harness</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The wiring harness was stripped to remove OBD1, fuel and O2 heat relays, gauge cluster, etc.</p>

    <p>Red Line racing oil for the motor, distilled water for cooling.</p>

    <p>Stock saddle tank removed, FuelSafe racing cell in the trunk. Holley 8psi first-stage pump, Kinsler swirl pot, metered return line, high-pressure second stage pump and filter. Interior send and return lines with fittings at the rear bulkhead and firewall. Stock fuel rail, regulator, and injectors. Electric fuel pressure gauge on the dash. Runs on pump gas.</p>

    <h2 id="suspension">Suspension and Brakes</h2>

    <p>Ground Control blah blah. spherical bearings, IE bars. Set up for Hoosier radial slicks. Wheels are (brand, size, weight?)</p>

    <p>ABS module deleted. Front-rear bias control mounted on tunnel next to driver seat.</p>

    <h2 id="drivetrain">Drive Train</h2>
    Five-speed Getrag 265, ClutchMasters Stage 5 ceramic clutch, B&M short shifter, stock drive shaft and center bearing, 4.10 rear diff (have original 3.73), stock axles and hubs. Delrin engine and gearbox mounts.  Red Line fluids used in gearbox and diff.

    <h2 id="exterior">Exterior</h2>

    <p>Fiberglass hood (5 pins). Ireland Engineering fiberglass deck lid (Dzus fastened). Lexan rear and quarter windows. Rear bumper delete. Sunroof delete. Plastic Ireland Engineering fender flares.</p>

    <p>The hood has a small crack from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_49XsE1LZNE">minor bounce off a tire wall at Summit Point</a> (oil on the track in a braking zone - yahoo!). The right front fender was replaced as a result (it's flat black and doesn't match the stock gloss black paint.) The damage was cosmetic; I raced the car later the same day without any problems.</p>

    <h2 id="interior">Interior</h2>

    <p>Roll cage built by Piper Motorsport. Anchored to firewall and rear floor. Includes door bars on the driver side, dead pedal, and window net attachment points. SCCA cage #42-3718.</p>

    <p>I also have a partial M3 composite body kit made by Mario Langsten at <a href="http://www.vsr1.com/">Vintage Sports & Restoration</a>. The kit includes air dam, hood (installed), front fenders, and side skirts. (VSR wasn't able to provide rear quarter panels or rear bumper cover.) Note that these are <i>not</i> BMW parts; they're lightweight composites. Make me an offer.</p>
