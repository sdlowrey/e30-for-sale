    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>Based on a 1987 BMW 325is, this car was tracked as a street car with various clubs before being prepped for SCCA E Production racing in 2009. The car was entered mostly in SCCA races and PDX events in the Mid-Atlantic area. Achieved several class wins and a season championship. Last event was October 2013.</p>

    <p>This is a solid, reliable car that's been stored in a climate-controlled garage. It starts and runs fine. Will need new tires and tech inspection. Could use some cosmetic touch-ups too. Otherwise, it's ready to go.</p>

    <p>Has SCCA logbook and documentation/paperwork for pretty much everything that I've worked on.</p>

    <h2 id="engine">Engine & Drivetrain</h2>
